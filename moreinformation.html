<html>The first member of the Pontypool branch of the Hanbury Family was Richard Hanbury, a goldsmith or banker of London, who was descended from the Worcestershire family founded by Roger de Hanbury (born 1125). He became a shareholder in the "Society of the Miners Royal" and the "Society of the Minerals and Battery Works," founded in 1568 to work the patents granted to William Humfray and Christopher Shutz "to explore for, and work mines of gold, silver, copper and quicksilver, and all other minerals and metals that might be discovered in England, Wales and the English pale in Ireland." Humfray and Shultz were the first to introduce into England the "science and faculty of the drawing and forging of iron and steel into wire by water works, a thing altogether foreign until that time." Works were established all over the country, including one with new buildings, engines and tools, for the manufacture of wire at Tintern where an iron works had previously existed, and ironworks (a furnace and two forges) at Monkswood to supply the Tintern works with the "osmond" iron necessary for producing wire. It was claimed that in 1588, 400 families were maintained by the Tintern works which had cost the Society £6,500 to build. Operations were also commenced on a mountain in Monmouthshire called Elgam, near a brook called Blaen Afon, in the Lordship of Abergavenny, and certain ores were discovered there suitable for the manufacture of iron works.

Hanbury in 1577 had renewed his lease of the Tintern Wire Works for£24, and made such profits that a shareholder suspected that he had not rendered true accounts when acting as manager. He therefore offered £200 a year and Hanbury bargained with him, offering £400 a year. He was bought out in 1591, when Cornelius Avenon, another shareholder, persuaded Captain Fennor and Mr. Challenor of the Pontymoel iron works to offer an annual rent of £666; in 1594 they owed the Company £1,200.

Hanbury made a contract with Challenor in 1591, as farmer of the Society's iron works, to deliver yearly for the works, 80 tons of "osmond" iron at £11 16s 8d per ton. 

He was to be allowed 38,000 cords (12 loads of charcoal made 41 cords - 5,125 cubic feet, of wood, were required to convert one ton of bar iron) of wood and 500 tons of "merchant" iron each year. With the wood however he had made large quantities of "merchant" iron out of the best "osmond" iron, which merchant iron he had made into bars and sold to blacksmiths to ,make scythes and other implements, "to his own lucre and gain." "Were it not for the malpractice's of Hanbury and others," the Society complained, "the iron mills at Monkswood could produce 20 tons of iron yearly and, together with the wire works, provide a living for 20,000 persons, the Society thus producing a dividend and a profit." "And although by lawe he knoweth that both the companie and their farmer may recover their several damages sustained by his default, yet knowing also that the said workes (Tintern) have no provision of good Osmond iron in that countrye but from him, bothe for that the best mynes in Monnouthshire for making of Osmond iron be his, and almost all the woods within ten miles compasse there be his also; all which it should seem that he had gotten into his hands purpose to bind the companie, their workes, and farmer to his purpose; and that it is not damage in longe tyme to be recovered, but the present use of his Osmond iron must uphold ye works."

On 5th June, the Privy Council summoned Hanbury and his partner to appear before it to answer a charge of supplying inferior iron to the Tintern works; it was stated that for twenty years he had secretly practiced at Monkswood, Abercarn and Glenebw the manufacture of "merchant iron" for himself which he had sold to the Society in such a way that from being a poor man he had now amassed great wealth. Andrew Palmer in the Lansdown MSS also says that "about the year 1577, Mr. Richard Hanbury gott to his handes two or three iron workes there in Wales, whereat he made much merchant iron to great gain." The Council in 1597 ordered Hanbury to delivery good iron from the ironworks at Pontypool to the Tintern wire works, and when he refused, he was on 15th April 1598, thrown into the Fleet Prison. He submitted on 25th July and agreed to pay the Society £100 annually for nine years and to deliver fifteen tons of good iron without delay.

Hanbury would seem to have increased his stranglehold on the Society by leasing from the Lordship of Abergavenny for less than £100 annual rent, the timber and minerals to be obtained on the mountainside from Pontypool to Blaenavon. His own works continued to produce iron in large quantities. The vessel Jonas of 18 tons in 1602 carried from Newport to Bridgewater 16 tons of Welsh iron on 20th February, 12 tons on 20th April, 15 tons on 1st June and 16 tons on the 5th August, all belonging to Richard Hanbury, described as "merchant."
Richard Hanbury died in 1608 possessed of the Pontypool works and others in Monmouthshire.</html>
